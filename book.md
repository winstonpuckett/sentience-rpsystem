# Character Composition

The composition of a character is determined by the sum of ones attributes, skills, and equipped items. When a player starts, they start at 0, with no (or minimal) equipment. Then as the game progresses, they level up attributes and skills 

## Attributes

### Overview

#### The Centers of Intelligence

As with the eneagram, there are three centers of intelligence. The mental, the social, and the physical. Each of these plays a very specific role in how characters interact with the universe. As the one who runs the game (the term "master branch" is deprecated. "Game master" and "dungeon master" seem tasteless, but... What's the replacement? Dungeon Mainer?)... Anyways, as the universe, you will need to understand these things deeply in order to set the stage of probability. 

#### Awareness and Displacement

Each center is a dyad of awareness and displacement. Awareness being the ability to perceive from the perspective of the center and displacement being the ability to effect change in the center. This may be easiest to see in the case of social intelligence. Some people are really in tune with others' emotions and intentions, but are not always able to steer conversations or decisions. The reverse is also true.

### The Mental Intelligence

Perhaps the most redundant title I've ever written.

The mental intelligence is all about logic, riddle, code, language, etc. This is what people characteristically think of when they define "intelligence" inside of their head.

#### Mental Awareness

Mental awareness has to do with perception. How in tune are you with your surroundings? A monk meditating on a mountain is a great example of mental awareness. Even with their eyes closed, they know the leaf fals in the water. They know the butterfly lands on their knee. 

Remember, to solve a puzzle, you must internalize it somehow.

#### Mental Displacement

Mental displacement happens after the puzzle is injested. It is the, "now that you have all of the pieces, can you find the answer?"

#### Examples

- Navigating using a map takes a low level mental awareness and a high level of mental displacement.
- Navigating without a map takes a high level of mental awareness and a low level of mental displacement (well, depending on where you're navigating).

### The Social Intelligence

The social intelligence is all about how you interact with creatures around you. This is primarily other sentient creatures, but does extend to govern all interactions regardless of how much of ones brain is made up of primordial instincts.

#### Social Awareness

Social Awareness is ones ability to perceive the intent of a comment and also if there is a hidden intent behind the comment. One with high enough social awareness can spot deception, know before an enemy engages in combat, predict the actions of individuals, etc.

#### Social Displacement

Social Displacement is how easily one can use their words to convey their meanings and get things done. Pursuasion, deception, implication, etc.

#### Examples

- Trying to reason with a king takes a high level of awareness and displacement, for it is very easy to offend a king by breaking a custom. The awareness allows you to use the customs to your advantage.
- Trying to intimidate a bar patron takes a high level of displacement and a low level of awareness.
- Trying to spot a spy based on their nervousness takes a high level of awareness and a low level of displacement.

### The Physical Intelligence

It may be worth noting that "physical" intelligence is slightly different than the instinctive center in the eneagram. The representation in the eneagram deals more with a spiritual in-tune-ness than the physical intelligence mentioned here. However, it is only a slight departure. The result of being in tune with ones instinctive center is can be greater bodily awareness and displacement. Therefore the study of the eneagram may still yield a better understanding of when to use this in ways which might not be immediately obvious.

#### Physical Awareness

This has to do with how the body is positioned or when one is feeling hungry/tired/aroused/etc. The closest attribute which would be represented in a classic system is agility and dexterity. Two attribtues which I've always believed should be the same.

#### Physical Displacement

Physical Displacement is how great an impact the character can make with their body. Strength. 

#### Examples

- Swinging a lead pipe requires high displacement and low awareness.
- Shooting an arrow takes high awareness and low displacement.
- Trying to dodge an arrow takes a high mental awareness (knowing where the arrow will land) and high physical awareness (knowing where your body should be when it does).

### Conclusion

And those are the triadic/dyadic attributes. The original name for this system was, "ditriad" named after the fact that each of the three centers has two parts. "Sentience" has a much nicer ring to it, but I still like the original name.

In shorthand form, each stat can be notated alone as the first letter of the center + the first letter of the dyad (Physical Awareness = PA). When written together on a character sheet, it can be useful to list them as "Center: Awareness Number / Displacement Number". For example, a character sheet might look like:

```
Mental: 0 / 3
Social: 2 / 1
Physical: 1 / 6
```

Where the first number is awareness and the second is displacement.

Next we will talk about skills, another third of the puzzle which makes up the character's composition.
