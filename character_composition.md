# Character Composition

The composition of a character is determined by the sum of one's attributes, skills, and equipped items. When a player starts, they start at 0, with no (or minimal) equipment. Then as the game progresses, they level up attributes/skills and gain new equipment which allow them to have more predictable impact on the universe.

## Attributes

Attributes govern how easy it is for a character to perform or prevent an action. If the character is not very social, but tries to pursuade someone of something, the chances of success would be low.

These attributes are trait-based, as in the Big Five personality profile. This means that we do not treat any attribute as a static thing, but instead recognize that these can go up and down as they do in real life. For the most part, attributes will go up as the characters level. In the event of trauma (character recovering from being knocked out, being kicked out of their parents' house, etc.) the attributes may go down.

### Overview

#### The Centers of Intelligence

As with the eneagram, there are three centers of intelligence. The mental, the social, and the physical. Each of these plays a very specific role in how characters interact with the universe. As the one who runs the game (the term "master branch" in programming is deprecated. "Game master" and "dungeon master" seem tasteless, but... What's the replacement? Dungeon Mainer?)... Anyways, as the universe, you will need to understand these things deeply in order to set the stage of probability. 

#### Awareness and Displacement

Each center is a dyad of awareness and displacement. Awareness being the ability to perceive from the perspective of the center and displacement being the ability to effect change in the center. This may be easiest to see in the case of social intelligence. Some people are really in tune with others' emotions and intentions, but are not always able to steer conversations or decisions. The reverse is also true.

### The Mental Intelligence

Perhaps the most redundant title I've ever written.

The mental intelligence is all about logic, riddle, code, language, etc. This is what people characteristically think of when they define "intelligence" inside of their head.

#### Mental Awareness

Mental awareness has to do with perception. How in tune are you with your surroundings? A monk meditating on a mountain is a great example of mental awareness. Even with their eyes closed, they know the leaf fals in the water. They know the butterfly lands on their knee. 

Remember, to solve a puzzle, you must internalize it somehow.

#### Mental Displacement

Mental displacement happens after the puzzle is injested. It is the, "now that you have all of the pieces, can you find the answer?" In a classic attribute system, this is the attribute that would be labeled as intelligence.

#### Examples

- Navigating using a map takes a low level mental awareness and a high level of mental displacement.
- Navigating without a map takes a high level of mental awareness and a low level of mental displacement (well, depending on where you're navigating).

### The Social Intelligence

The social intelligence is all about how you interact with creatures around you. This is primarily other sentient creatures, but does extend to govern all interactions regardless of how much of ones brain is made up of primordial instincts.

#### Social Awareness

Social Awareness is ones ability to perceive the intent of another's cues. One with high enough social awareness can spot deception, know before an enemy engages in combat, predict the actions of individuals, etc.

#### Social Displacement

Social Displacement is how easily one can use their words to convey their meanings and get things done. Pursuasion, deception, implication, etc.

#### Examples

- Trying to reason with a king takes a high level of awareness and displacement, for it is very easy to offend a king by breaking a custom.
- Trying to intimidate a bar patron takes a high level of displacement and a low level of awareness.
- Trying to spot a spy based on the spy's nervousness takes a high level of awareness and a low level of displacement.

### The Physical Intelligence

It may be worth noting that "physical" intelligence is slightly different than the instinctive center in the eneagram. The representation in the eneagram deals more with a spiritual in-tune-ness than the physical intelligence mentioned here. However, it is only a slight departure. The result of being in tune with ones instinctive center is can be greater bodily awareness and displacement. Therefore the study of the eneagram may still yield a better understanding of when to use this in ways which might not be immediately obvious.

#### Physical Awareness

This has to do with how the body is positioned or when one is feeling hungry/tired/aroused/etc. The closest attribute which would be represented in a classic system is agility and dexterity. Two attribtues which I've always believed should be the same.

#### Physical Displacement

Physical Displacement is how great an impact the character can make with their body. Strength.

#### Examples

- Swinging a lead pipe requires high displacement and low awareness.
- Shooting an arrow takes high awareness and low displacement.
- Trying to dodge an arrow takes a high mental awareness (knowing where the arrow will land) and high physical awareness (knowing where your body should be when it does).

### Conclusion

And those are the triadic/dyadic attributes. The original name for this system was, "ditriad" named after the fact that each of the three centers has two parts. "Sentience" has a much nicer ring to it, but I still like the original name.

In shorthand form, each stat can be notated alone as the first letter of the center + the first letter of the dyad (Physical Awareness = PA). When written together on a character sheet, it can be useful to list them as "Center: Awareness Number / Displacement Number". For example, a character sheet might look like:

```
Mental: 0 / 3
Social: 2 / 1
Physical: 1 / 6
```

Where the first number is awareness and the second is displacement.

Next we will talk about skills, another third of the puzzle which makes up the character's composition.

## Skills

Skills determine whether a character can use a particular piece of equipment or attempt a specific roll. Skill requirements are notated on equipment.

- If the character's skill is one less than the requirement, the character rolls with disadvantage (rolling two dice and picking the lower number)
- If the character's skill is two less than the requirement, the character must roll at natural twenty. If the difficulty is more than twenty, there is no way to roll correctly.
- If the character's skill is more than two less than the requirement, there is no way to roll successfully, but depending on the narative, there may be ways to fail entertainingly.

## Tool Proficiency

How easily can a character manipulate a keyboard? Play an instrument? Some tools, lead pipes for instance, don't require a lot of finger nimbleness. Other tools need you to be able to quickly manipulate parts in complex matters

## Ranged Proficiency

How well can a character calculate the tradjectory of a weapon? Whether it's a rock or a gun, being able to see the arc and aim effectively at range is a unique and valuable skill.

## Stealth

Can the character move without being seen by a group?

## Performance

Can the character draw and entertain a crowd?

## Healing

How well does the character understand what heals? This is definitely a knowledge of which medicines to use, but also extends to bone setting, etc.

## Maker

Does the character know how to fit items together to be more than the sum of their parts? Can they create machines to automate watering the lawn? How to make trip wires? Shovels? Fires from wood, flint, and steel?

## Conclusion

If you haven't noticed, each skill relates heavily to one of the centers of intelligence. There are two skills for each center. This doesn't really have an effect on the game as far as I can tell, but it's interesting none the less.

These 6 skills can be laid out simply on the character sheet like:

```
Tool Proficiency: 1
Ranged Proficiency: 0
Stealth: 3
Performance: 0
Healing: 1
Maker: 2
```

# Items

Items are fairly simple in terms of concept. Here is a bulleted list of things to remember

- Items typically provide modifications to the base attributes. 
- These modifications can and *should* have positive and negative effects.
- Most items have skill requirements to be used effectively. 
- A character cannot equip more items than is reasonable for them. Sure, if they have 6 arms, they might be able to use 6 hand axes... But not 8.
- There may be certain items which require all of the focus for a body part and be marked with "All hands." For instance, doing complex math on a calculator only requires one hand, but you won't be wielding a sword while you're doing it. You could however run away and use your feet while doing complex math.
- Because items may be changed out, it may be useful to store these items on a separate physical piece of paper than the character sheet.

## Examples

Remember that all attributes have two letter acronyms as discussed above.

```
Lead Pipe
Requirements:
- Tool Proficiency 1
- One Hand
Effects:
- PD +2
- PA -2
```

```
Short Bow
Requirements:
- Tool Proficiency 1
- Ranged Proficiency 2
- Two Hands
Effects:
- PA +3
- MA -2
```
