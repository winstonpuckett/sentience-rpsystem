# Adversarial Situations

## Principle

Both parties role a D20 to see if they hit. 
If the defender is equal/higher, nothing happens.
The damage done is the attacker's role - defenders (max of the attribute itself, minimum of 1)

Example:

Jonny BD: 5
Steve BA: 6 

Jonny hits Steve with a led pipe.
J: Roles a 13 + 5 BD
S: Roles a 1 + 6 BA

Steve takes 5 damage because 18 - 7 is greater than the max Jonny can do

## Standard counters (Attacker / Defender)

Melee Attack: BD / BA
Ranged Attack: BA / MA
Persuasion: SD / SD
Intimidation: SD / MA

## Unopposed roles

Investigation: MA
Insight: SA
Pulling a Lever: BD
