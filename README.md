This is in pre-alpha state. Please note that there will most likely be major breaking changes. If you'd like to use this for a campaign, it might be a good idea to clone or fork the repo to get a consistent version.

# Sentience Role Playing System

This is a classless, raceless table-top RPG system for people wanting to progressively refine characters instead of choosing their identies beforehand.

# Why / Foreward

I once played a campaign with smart individuals who had never been introduced to pen-and-paper RPGs. They chose entirely the wrong character stack for their prefered method of interacting with the universe. This made me wonder if there was a better way to create a full-featured campaign than to request individuals make choices they knew nothing about.

I've also studied the Eneagram, Myers-Briggs, and Big Five personality profiles extensively and I have become dissatisfied with the classic attribute definitions.

Both of these points have led me to create a new system which encompasses what I believe to be a better representation of how people process information. And because everyone starts at 0, no one is forced to invest skill points that they don't understand. You gain skill by using your skills. Your character naturally becomes the type of person you start playing as.
